          <para>. - I take it that the House will concur with me in saying that the telegram received from the Secretary of State for the Colonies will receive proper attention. I shall ask  His Excellency  the Governor-General to send a suitable answer, which, I hope, will have the approval of the House. I shall also ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to answer the telegram sent from the Presbyterian Assembly. </para>
