          <para>. - I have no objection to moving that the House meet at half-past three, if there is no objection on the part of honorable members. Or, if more convenient, we might say four o'clock - that is, for that day only, of course. I intend to ask honorable members to make half-past two o'clock the ordinary hour of sitting, except on Fridays, on which day I shall ask them to sit at two o'clock. </para>
