            <para>- I have great pleasure in seconding the motion. In common with, I think, all other honorable members of this House, I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> has, by his services in the cause of Federation, amply deserved all the confidence we can possibly place in him. I feel that he will rule over our proceedings with that dignity and that even-handed justice which are so especially required on the part of a  Speaker.  The only regret that I have in this connexion is that in electing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder</inline> to the Speakership, we shall lose his valuable services on the floor of the House. I believe the feeling is general 071 both sides of the chamber that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder,</inline> by reason of his eminent qualifications, deserves the high position to which it is proposed that he shall be elected. I think that I can say for those who will sit on the left of the chair that we are entirely in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder's</inline> election, and that we shall be highly gratified to see it come to pass. </para>
